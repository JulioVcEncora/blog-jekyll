title: Custom ledger-cli program using JavaScript
--- 

Though this week went by pretty fast, it was filled with lots of work. I feel like week by week I’m growing outstandingly with the projects we are being assigned with. Last week's project was about creating a script like program based on ledger-cli. Ledger-cli is an accounting tool that outputs a double entry registry based on a text document. We were free to choose the programming language of our preference, and our program was required to accept the balance, register and print commands with the flags –price-db, --sort and –file.  

As a first option I wanted to use Python because of the short syntax and extensive libraries it possesses. As I was researching how to work this project, I realized that I could also solve it using JavaScript and therefore made my decision to use it as the main programming language. I decided to initialize my project using yarn instead of npm since I believe that when using multiple dependencies yarn is faster than npm.  
 
During the first half of the deadline for the project I worked on reading all the relevant documentation of ledger-cli so that I could get a major understanding of what was happening behind the scenes. I also had to re study basic accounting topics since there were a couple of concepts that I didn’t remember as well as I would've wanted.  

On the second week of the project, I got sick of dengue, and I was really getting the chills, so I could only get to work only for a couple of hours a day before feeling down again. By the end of the week, I had finished the basic structure for the basic commands (register, balance and print), written my basic script file so that the JavaScript file would run on command, and enabled the flag –file. I couldn’t meet all the mandatory requirements by deadlines, but I would like to keep working on them during the week.

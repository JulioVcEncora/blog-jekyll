title: MJ Foundation and AWS Courses
--- 

This week has been extremely exciting, during the first half of this week I continued taking aws certification courses, but on the third day of the week e got exciting news, we have our first real client, which the Maria Jose Foundaton which helps people with Prader Willis Syndrome with medicine and other great stuff which helps their families a lot.

Starting from the courses I took for aws certification exam, I could finally finish all the module 1 topics, which covered a lot of definitions and contextual material. I believe this first module was like this so that we can have a good foundation for when we try to create or manage any aws service. The topics I can highlight from this first module, are ec2 instances, ecs containers, lambdas, s3 and a general review all of what aws can do.

About the Maria Jose Foundation, I'm feeeling pretty excited to work with this client since we're going to help them create their main dashboard so that they can have a better understanding of the data they receive from the patients they're currently helping. We are also going to provide a new registration form for new coming patients. This changes are because they curretly don't possess a correct structure for reading or inputting all of their data and sometimes they struggle to find certain information. I love the idea to help this foundation since I'm going to learn a lot for providing a solution to an organization that helps people.

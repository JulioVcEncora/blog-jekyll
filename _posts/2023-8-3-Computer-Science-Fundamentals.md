title: Creating my first endpoint using SpringBoot
---

This week has been, in my opinion, extremely loaded with theory concepts which in my case I must take my time to really understand and learn them. Despite the heavily loaded theorical part, we also had an integration activity called newbies Friday with some of the encora's team. Lastly, this week has been cataloged as values week, so we’ve had multiple live streams with people from encora all around the world talking about the importance of our core values.  

The theory we learnt during this week was all about Java core concepts. We have been learning this since we must work with three different projects related to creating a java backend service. This is my first time working with java, but I can’t feel any more excited about working with this since it has been on my mind for a couple of years to learn java. One little big thing that I’m proud of is when I made my first endpoint for the Cinema Room Rest project, I felt like I was writing facebook. Diving deeply into the concepts I learnt this week, it was all about spring-boot, starting a rest service, using annotations to handle rest controllers and http methods, lambda expressions and working with different threads. 

For the newbies Friday event, we had to organize different activities with a duration of approximately 2 hours so that we could get to know more about people from the company and so that they could get to know us better. The activities we did were interesting and fun since we had to use our creativity to come up with solutions. The main game we played is called gartic phone, where people had to write some random sentences and afterwards, we had to draw that sentence so that the following person could write the sentence from our drawing. 

In conclusion, this week taught me that I have to keep being disciplined in my working schedule so that I can finish my projects on time. I also learnt the importance of having well established values so that I can have a healthy work environment and also be recognized because of my core values.
